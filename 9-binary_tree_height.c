/**
 * binary_tree_height - Measures the height of a binary tree.
 *
 * @tree: A pointer to the root node of the tree to measure the height.

 * Return: The height of the binary tree. Returns 0 if the tree is NULL.
 *
 * Description: This function calculates the height of a binary tree by
 *              counting the number of edges on the longest path from the
 *              root node to a leaf node.
